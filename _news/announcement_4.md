Started my research visit for the Fall 2024 semester at the [ORFE Department](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University under the supervision of Prof. Jianqing Fan. Additionally, weekend trips to Boston for the GAC and the Studienstiftung conference are on my agenda. If you’re around, let’s get in touch!
