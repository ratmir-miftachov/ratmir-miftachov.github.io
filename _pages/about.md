Hello there! I am a fourth-year PhD student in Statistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.

My research interests span **nonparametric statistics**, **statistical machine learning** and **financial econometrics**. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wolfgang Karl HÃ¤rdle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XMlSKFcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).

Currently, I am mainly working on early stopping methods for decision trees and the random forest.
