Hello there! I am a third-year PhD student in Statistics at Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany.

I am interested in **nonparametric statistics** and **financial econometrics**. 

Over the next years, I will share my research and possibly other interesting insights on this website. Stay tuned! :rocket:
