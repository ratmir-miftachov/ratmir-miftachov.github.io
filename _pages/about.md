Hello there! I am a PhD student in Statistics at Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany, currently in the final year of my program.

My research interests span **nonparametric statistics** and **statistical machine learning**. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Wolfgang Karl Härdle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XMlSKFcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).

Currently, I am thinking about model distillation.
